The {\ttfamily Mpp\+Core} class provides an abstract interface for core neural network layers, such as linear and activation layers. It defines virtual methods that derived classes must implement or can override, supporting core functionality such as parameter access, gradient management, and printing. This class enables polymorphism across different neural network components.
