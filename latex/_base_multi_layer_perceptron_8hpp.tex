The {\ttfamily Base\+Multi\+Layer\+Perceptron} class offers core functionality for MLP networks, including gradient zeroing, parameter updates, and basic parameter display methods. It manages a {\ttfamily Sequential} object which allows chaining of neural network layers, simplifying MLP structure and functionality.
